# Polymorphism - Articulate

## Overview
Articulate the principle of polymorphism.

## Instructions
Now that you have learned about the principle of polymorphism, and designed and developed a program using it, return to I-Learn and answer the following question (the way you would in a job interview):

What is polymorphism and why is it important?

Your response must:

- Explain the meaning of Polymorphism
- Highlight a benefit of Polymorphism
- Provide an application of Polymorphism
- Use a code example of Polymorphism from the program you wrote
- Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words)


# Response:

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they belong to a common class or share a common interface. The term "polymorphism" comes from the Greek words "poly," meaning "many," and "morph," meaning "form."

There are two main types of polymorphism: static and dynamic. Static polymorphism is achieved through method overloading, which allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters to coexist within a class. Dynamic polymorphism, on the other hand, is achieved through method overriding, which allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method defined in its superclass.

Polymorphism is important for several reasons:

Reusability: Polymorphism enables developers to reuse code across different classes and objects, reducing the amount of code that needs to be written and making it easier to maintain and modify code.

Flexibility: Polymorphism allows for greater flexibility in programming, as it allows objects to be treated in a more abstract and general way, rather than being tied to specific types or implementations.

Encapsulation: Polymorphism helps to enforce the principle of encapsulation, which is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that promotes the idea of hiding implementation details from the user of a class.

Extensibility: Polymorphism allows for easy extension of existing code, as new classes can be created that implement existing interfaces or inherit from existing classes, without having to modify the original code.

In summary, polymorphism is an important concept in object-oriented programming that allows for greater flexibility, reusability, encapsulation, and extensibility in software development.

## Response items

### 1
Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a specific routine to use variables of different types at different times. It is the ability of a programming language to present the same interface for several different underlying data types and different objects to respond in a unique way to the same message.

### 2
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

### 3
Polymorphism, in C#, is the ability of objects of different types to provide a unique interface for different implementations of methods. It is usually used in the context of late binding, where the behavior of an object to respond to a call to its method members is determined based on object type at run time. Polymorphism enables redefining methods in derived classes.

Polymorphism forms one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming, along with encapsulation and inheritance.

An example of polymorphism is an employee base class, which includes all the basic details about employees. Classes such as clerk and manager could inherit from the employee base class with specific implementations (by overriding virtual methods) wherever necessary in the derived classes.
