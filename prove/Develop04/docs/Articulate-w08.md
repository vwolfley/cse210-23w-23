# Inheritance - Articulate W08

## Overview

Articulate the principle of inheritance.

## Instructions

Now that you have learned about the principle of inheritance, and designed and developed a program using it, return to I-Learn and answer the following question (the way you would in a job interview):

What is inheritance and why is it important?

Your response must:

- Explain the meaning of Inheritance
- Highlight a benefit of Inheritance
- Provide an application of Inheritance
- Use a code example of Inheritance from the program you wrote
- Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words)


## Response


Inheritance is one of the fundamental attributes of object-oriented programming. It allows you to define a child class that reuses (inherits), extends, or modifies the behavior of a parent class. The class whose members are inherited is called the base class.


In C#, inheritance allows us to create a new class from an existing class. It is a key feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The derived class inherits the fields and methods of the base class. This helps with the code reusability in C#.

It's a concept in programming that speaks about productivity, and readability. Inheritance reduces or eliminates the need for repeated code.

In programming, inheritance is the mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This means that a new class can be created by extending an existing class, which provides the new class with all the features of the existing class, as well as the ability to add new features or override existing ones.

One of the key benefits of inheritance is that it allows code to be reused, which can save time and effort in development. Rather than creating a new class from scratch, developers can simply extend an existing class and modify it as needed. This can help to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written, as well as make it easier to maintain and update code over time.

An example of inheritance in action can be seen in object-oriented programming languages like Java. For instance, a developer may create a base class called "Animal" that includes properties and methods common to all animals, such as "name", "age", and "eat". They could then create new classes, such as "Dog" or "Cat", that inherit from the Animal class and add additional properties or methods specific to those animals, such as "bark" or "meow". By doing so, the new classes can reuse the existing code and functionality from the base class, while still being able to add new features that are unique to them.

In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a mechanism that enables a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods. The existing class is called the parent class or superclass, while the new class is referred to as the child class or subclass. Inheritance allows the child class to reuse code and functionality from the parent class, which can save time and effort in writing new code.

One of the benefits of inheritance is that it promotes code reuse and avoids redundancy. Instead of writing new code for every class, developers can create a base class with common properties and methods, and then have other classes inherit from it. This can save significant amounts of time and effort, especially when dealing with large and complex applications.

An example of inheritance in action could be creating a new class called "Vehicle" that has properties such as "number of wheels", "fuel type", and "maximum speed". From this base class, you could then create child classes such as "Car", "Motorcycle", and "Truck", which would inherit the properties of the "Vehicle" class while adding their own unique properties and methods. This approach can save time and effort when developing complex applications, as the developer can focus on building out the unique features of each child class without needing to recreate the basic functionality of the parent class.

In summary, inheritance is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming that allows developers to reuse code, avoid redundancy, and save time and effort when building complex applications.
