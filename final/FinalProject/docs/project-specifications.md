# Open-ended Project Description

## Program Specification
Think of a problem that people have that could be solved with programming, similar to the approach we have taken this semester. Write a program that uses the principles of Programming with Classes to help solve this problem.

You are welcome to explore and use any libraries you would like, such as graphics, networking, Web, etc. Just make sure you get a chance to show that you are using the principles of this class. (You cannot use Unity or other frameworks like that, because you won't be able to demonstrate that you know how to write the code we have learned this semester.)

## Guidelines

To be eligible for full credit, your program must:

1. Perform an interesting task or function.
2. Be completely written by you (it cannot simply add to an existing project.)
3. Be written in C# (and not in a "low code" environment such as Unity).
4. Use at least 8 classes.
5. Demonstrate the principle of abstraction.
   - Classes should have specific responsibilities and collaborate with each other.
6. Demonstrate the principle of encapsulation.
   - Internal details should be private, external methods should be available for public behaviors.
7. Demonstrate the principle of inheritance.
   - Code should not be duplicated that could be place in a base class.
8. Demonstrate the principle of polymorphism.
   - Methods that are unique to a derived class should be defined in a base class, and overridden in a derived class.

If you feel the best design for your program does not require inheritance or polymorphism, you should clearly demonstrate your understanding of these principles by explaining the design decisions that led you to this decision.
